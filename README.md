# Pygrapher
Use python to do curve fitting as easy as excel

## Introduction

Based on scipy, numpy and matplotlib

numpy.polyfit were used to fit polynomial function because scipy.optimize.curve_fit were based on signature of a function, so *args and **kwargs will be an issue if we cannot define the accurate number of inputs while defining a new function

## Installation

```pip install pygrapher```
